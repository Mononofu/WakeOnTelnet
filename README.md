WakeOnTelnet
-------------------------

WakeOnTelnet is a simple App to remotely control your Pioneer VSX-921 receiver. 
It should also work with different receivers from Pioneer - as far as I know, 
they all use the same network protocol.

However, currently I've hardcoded the IP of the receiver, so you'd need to change
that for your own receiver.

Features
-------------------------

  * mute / unmute
  * power on / off
  * volume control
  * switch between input sources
  * schedule sleep timers 
  * schedule alarms - use your receiver as personal alarm clock
